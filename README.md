## Basic overview

**Pravda** is a tool that uses steganography to hide information in the subtitles of MP4 video files. Additionally, you can upload the videos with subtitles to platforms like YouTube and share information with people who know the password.

## Dependencies

You can find a list of required Python modules dependencies in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/JavDomGom/pravda/blob/main/requirements.txt).

## How to use

1. Clone repo and change to **src** folder.
    ```bash
    ~$ git clone https://github.com/JavDomGom/pravda.git
    ~$ cd src
    ```


2. To hide some message in video execute the following command.
    ```bash
    ~/src$ python3 -u main.py -i https://youtu.be/BGTRqGeIxOA -l a.en -w -m "Hello world!"
    Password: V3ry5eCur3p4S5w0rD
    ```
   This command will download the video that we have chosen directly from YouTube, it must be a video with subtitles (autogenerated subtitles are also valid). Pravda makes a some modifications to the subtitle and reassemble it with MP4 file. As a result we will obtain in the **mp4** folder an MP4 file with the new subtitles included, and in the **srt** folder an SRT file with the subtitles in plain text and with timing.


3. It's time to upload the MP4 file to YouTube. It is essential to select the language of the video on YouTube, in this example we will use "English" since both the audio of the video and the subtitles are in English. In addition, we must upload the SRT file generated in the previous step with the subtitles, and we have to specify that they are subtitles **with time**. Depending on the duration of the video, it may take a few seconds or a few minutes for the video to upload and be available, be patient. Don't forget to copy the link of the newly uploaded video, you will need it to share it with the recipients of your hidden message.


4. To read a hidden message in the subtitles of a YouTube video, we must know the manipulated video URL (for example https://youtu.be/-npFIQSm27s), and execute the following command.
   ```bash
   ~/src$ python3.9 -u main.py -i https://youtu.be/-npFIQSm27s -l en -r
   Password: V3ry5eCur3p4S5w0rD
   Hello world!S
   ```
   You must know and enter the same password that was used to hide the message. You will see that there are residual characters at the end of the hidden message, it's normal, as many residual characters will appear as the capacity of the video and its subtitles to write. If the password entered is wrong, no error will be printed on the screen output, it will simply show a series of meaningless characters.
